Description: Implements the Wasserstein Transfer Learning (WaTL) algorithm for
    distribution regression. The package provides methods for combining information
    from target and source datasets to improve prediction accuracy when dealing with
    distributional responses. The algorithm uses weighted auxiliary estimators,
    bias correction, and projection to the Wasserstein space. See Zhang et al. (2025)
    <arXiv:2505.17404> for details.
